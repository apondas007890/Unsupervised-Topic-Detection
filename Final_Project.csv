"Erling Haaland has signed a new 9.5-year deal at Manchester City that will keep him at the Etihad until 2034, the Premier League champions announced on Friday."
The 24-year-old striker's existing contract was due to expire in June 2027 but he has now committed his future to the club for the next decade.
"The deal is the longest in the Premier League, eclipsing the nine-year contract Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea year and Haaland's salary will reportedly be about £500,000 ($610,000) per week."
"A post on the club's X account read: ""Erling's here to stay! We're thrilled to announce Erling Haaland has extended his contract at City to 2034."""
"The Norwegian made an instant impact after joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, firing 52 goals in all competitions to help the club win a Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in his first season."
He scored a further 38 goals last season as City won a fourth consecutive league title and his overall tally stands at 111 goals in 126 games for the club.
"""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said Haaland."
"""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody."
"""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years. They have made this such a special place to be and now I am City no matter what."""
"City's outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain said: ""Everyone at the club is absolutely delighted that Erling has signed his new contract."
"""The fact he is signed for so long demonstrates our commitment to him as a player, and his love of this club."
"""He has made an incredible impact already in his time here and his amazing numbers and records speak for themselves."""
"Haaland's extension is a major boost for City in a season where they have unexpectedly struggled on the pitch, with the club sitting sixth, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool."
It also appears to be a huge show of faith from the player at a time when the club is waiting to learn the outcome of a major disciplinary case.
"City faced an independent commission hearing last year to examine more than 100 charges from the Premier League concerning alleged breaches of its financial rules, charges the club have always strenuously denied."
The new contract renewal comes two months after Guardiola's decision to sign a new two-year deal of his own.
